# Testing Policy

FlipFlapp uses **strict TDD**. This is the **directing workflow for every feature** — not an afterthought.

Business rules: [DOMAIN.md](DOMAIN.md). Run specs: [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md). Agent policy: [AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md).

---

## Feature workflow (TDD)

Use this sequence for every behavior change:

```
1. You describe what the feature must do
2. Agent reads DOMAIN.md, flags ambiguities and edge cases — you answer
3. DOMAIN.md updated if the rule is new or changed
4. Migrations proposed if needed — you validate before any migration file is created
5. Failing specs written in spec/models/ (and spec/requests/ when HTTP wiring matters); framework commands proposed first when boilerplate is needed
6. Implementation until specs pass (model first, then controllers / views / API as needed)
```

### Step 1 — You describe the feature

Explain the expected behavior in product terms. Reference models when possible (`Event`, `Friendship`, `Notification`, etc.).

### Step 2 — Clarify before coding

The agent must read [DOMAIN.md](DOMAIN.md) and ask about:

- public vs private `Event`
- which `User` records can see, join, or invite
- which `EventTeam` / `EventParticipant` records change
- which `Notification` records are created or removed
- whether `role: admin` or a schema change is involved
- edge cases you care about

Do not start specs or code while behavior is still ambiguous.

### Step 3 — Domain doc

If the rule is new or changes MVP behavior, update [DOMAIN.md](DOMAIN.md) first (or in the same PR as the specs, after you confirm the rule).

### Step 4 — Migrations (only with your approval)

A feature request does **not** imply permission to migrate.

- If the feature needs a new column, table, or index, the agent **proposes** the migration and explains why.
- **You validate** the migration plan before any `db/migrate/` file is created.
- When approved: migration + model validations + indexes + model specs together.
- Do not run `bin/rails db:migrate` unless you explicitly ask.

Current schema: `db/schema.rb`.

### Step 5 — Red: specs

- Write or update specs in **`spec/models/`** first for domain rules.
- Add **`spec/requests/`** when the HTTP contract must be locked (status, auth, side effects exposed via endpoints).
- Specs describe **behavior** from [DOMAIN.md](DOMAIN.md), not implementation details.
- Use **Factory Bot** (`spec/factories/`). No YAML fixtures.
- No `pending` examples.
- Prefer `expect { }.to change` for `Notification` and record side effects.
- Prefer focused hand-written specs matching nearby files. Do not generate a model or scaffold merely to obtain a spec file.

Run (when you ask):

```bash
rspec spec/models/
rspec spec/requests/
rspec spec/models/event_spec.rb
```

Uses `TEST_NEON_DB` — see [DEVELOPMENT.md](DEVELOPMENT.md).

### Step 6 — Green: implementation

1. **`app/models/`** — smallest change to pass specs (validations, scopes, callbacks, methods).
2. **Controllers / views / Stimulus** — only to expose behavior already covered by model specs.
3. **JSON API** — after web flows, same domain rules and specs as source of truth.

Refactor only when it makes the tested behavior clearer. No service objects unless you explicitly request them.

---

## Non-negotiable rules

- Model specs **before** (or with) behavior changes — never specs after the fact.
- **`spec/models/`** and **`spec/requests/`** only — no view, helper, system, or feature specs.
- Factory Bot only; no YAML fixtures; no `pending` examples.
- Agents do **not** run `rspec`, `db:migrate`, or other commands unless you explicitly ask.

---

## What to test

Specs lock **backend behavior** from [DOMAIN.md](DOMAIN.md). They are the source of truth for the future iOS and Android JSON API — same rules, same side effects.

**`spec/models/`** — domain rules and data side effects:

- validations and uniqueness
- associations that enforce rules
- callbacks and data side effects
- `Notification` creation and cleanup
- `Friendship` and `Event` visibility / access rules
- `EventParticipant` and `EventTeam` (`slot`, `label`) rules
- data integrity after create, update, and destroy

**`spec/requests/`** — HTTP contract when it matters:

- authentication and authorization (who can call an endpoint)
- successful and rejected writes (e.g. join rejected when full)
- backend side effects visible through the API (records created or destroyed)

Example: accepting a `Friendship` request **creates a `Notification`** → test in model or request spec.  
Example: a **flash message** after the action → do **not** test; verify visually in the browser.

## What not to test

- **Views and front-end** — HTML layout, ERB structure, CSS, Tailwind classes, Stimulus display behavior
- **Visually verifiable UI** — flash messages, button labels, page copy, redirect targets you can see in the browser
- **Helpers** — formatting helpers, presentation-only code
- **System / feature specs** — no Capybara or browser-driven tests

When in doubt: if the behavior is **data the mobile apps will need** (records, fields, kinds, access rules), test it. If it is **only how the web page looks or reads**, do not test it.

---

## Spec style

- One spec file per model (`spec/models/event_spec.rb`, etc.).
- `describe` blocks by behavior: `"validations"`, `"notifications"`, `"access rules"`.
- `create` / `build` from factories; traits for meaningful variants.
- Test names state the business rule in plain language.
